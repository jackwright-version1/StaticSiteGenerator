# Roadmap

Last Updated: 11/08/2021

## Overview
This page details the roadmap specific to this accelerator. For the wider DAPx roadmap detailing additional accelerators to be developed, please [visit our DAPx portal](https://version1.sharepoint.com/sites/dapx/SitePages/Roadmap.aspx). 

## Roadmap

### Immediate

* Add required non-functional requirements for immediate Highways England Opportunity
* This accelerator has been designed specifically as a POC for the NILO project in Highways England. This will shortly be genericised and moved to a new set of repositories indicating this is a fully-fledged "Generally Available" accelerator, and not just a PoC.

### Medium-term (H1 2022)

* This accelerator will be basis for a related accelerator that uses a microservices-based architecture with a Single Page Application UI. The MVC repository will not be used for that accelerator, instead a .NET Core API repo will be created.
* Consideration will then be given to making reusable components across both .NET Core and .NET MVC such as Logging, Error Handling etc. I.e. can we extract .NET code into shared libraries both accelerators can use to configure various best practices.

### Long-term (H2 2022+)

* Continue to incorporate latest best practices.
* Evaluate the continued need for an MVC based accelerator.
